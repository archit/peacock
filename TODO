TODO -- list of items/features still to be implemented in Peacock-2
Copyright (C) 2003 Archit Baweja <bighead@users.sourceforge.net>

Here's the legend

[C] - completed.
[W] - someone is working on it.
[ ] - still to be started work on.

Big Stuff
---------

[W]	Implement the GNOME_Peacock_File control. This is going to be used
	instead of the GNOME_GtkHTML_Editor control which will infact be
	embedded in the Peacock_File control. (Archit Baweja)
	
[ ]	Implement the PeacockSite control. A hint of how it should be is, look
	at the Macromedia Dreamweaver Site control. Talk to me about the rest.

Small Stuff
-----------

[C]	Get Find/Find Again/Replace edit menu ops working. (Archit Baweja)

[ ]	Get the PeacockHTMLToolbars object to communicate with the PeacockMDI
	and subsequently with PeacockFile.

[C]	Put a GtkStatusbar (or better still GnomeAppBar) in PeacockWindow,
	and create an IDL interface to it.
