      <title>Motivation</title>

      <para>
	Till recently, most people in linux, used their favourite editor,
	be it vi or emacs, to make HTML pages. Now with modern and mature
	Desktop Environments coming up, GUI based HTML Editor are
	surfacing in the Linux scene. Peacock is one such GUI HTML Editor
	which is being developed to fill the gap.
      </para>

      <para>
	The Peacock's authors are developing it using the latest Gnome
	technologies, to answer the need of the Gnome community for a
        Gnome complaint HTML Editor.

    <title>Features</title>

    <para>
      Peacock is a semi WYSIWYG editor. You have to type the HTML yourself.
      But the <emphasis>html toolbars</emphasis> are there for your comfort.
      There is however GtkHTML based Preview functionality, as of version 0.4.
      In time I hope to add GtkHTML based editing capability, thus making
      Peacock a fully functional WYSIWYG HTML editor.

    <para>
      Peacock has some very nifty features, including...

      <para>
        The most notable of Peacock's features are its HTML Toolbars. These
        toolbars, grouped by the category of HTML tags they allow you to
        insert, provide an easy way to insert the commonly used HTML tags.
        thus saving you precious time and keystrokes.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, if you want to insert the FORM tag, you click on the
        <emphasis>Forms</emphasis> tab in the HTML Toolbars and then click
        on the <emphasis>Insert Form Tag</emphasis> button.

      <para>
        Peacock is probably one of the first (if not the only) HTML Editor in
        Gnome, to support GtkHTML based Preview. For each document, there are
        two tabs, marked as <emphasis>HTML</emphasis> and <emphasis>Preview
        </emphasis>. The HTML tab shows the HTML code of the webpage. The
        Preview tab shows the page, how it would probably look in a browser.
        No more firing up netscape to see what your page looks like :-).

        Peacock also supports Drag N' Drop. To open a file you simply drag the
        file from GMC or the Desktop onto the Peacock main window.

    <title>Peacock Preferences</title>

    <para>
      The Preferences Dialog allows you to configure the Peacock HTML Editor.
      From which HTML Toolbars are shown, to wether to insert the author's
      information using meta tags, all is done from the Preferences Dialog.
      It takes advantage of the new GConf Database to store its preferences,
      making Peacock complaint with the Gnome 1.4 desktop.
