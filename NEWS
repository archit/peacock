New in 0.6
* Find and/or Replace - I finally added the Find and/or Replace functions. 
  Something basic everyone expects from any kind of editor (text, html etc).
* The wonderful world of GnomeVFS - All the file operations have been shifted
  to the GnomeVFS architecture (previously it was the POSIX complaint standard
  C FILE API). This means you can edit files directly from the web, ftp,
  even across networks using protocols like Samba etc, basically the ones
  supported by GnomeVFS. Including those from secured sites which require
  usernames/passwords.
  Example: ftp://username@password:ftp.mysite.com/my/websites/files/index.html
* GtkHTML Preview click functionality - now you can click on a link in the
  Preview Pane, and Peacock will open the new file for you in the editor.
  Something to pamper the lazy web hacker.

New in 0.5
* GConf + PonG based preferences - Now the user has the ability to customize 
  to his own needs, including 
	o toggles to show/hide the Main toolbar and HTML toolbars now use GConf
	o show/hide desired HTML toolbars
* Templates - A very basic template thinggie. Every new file opened, has the
  basic HTML tags already in there. Just some convinience to the HTML coder.

New in 0.4
* GtkHTML based Preview - the Preview functionality using GtkHTML is working
  now. So no more firing up of netscape each time you want to see how your
  webpage will look like!
* File Browser - an inbuilt 'one click file browser' is now available in the
  main window. Note however there are serious problems with resizing of the
  main application window when File Browser is shown. So by default hidden.
  To enable : Main Menu -> Settings -> View File Browser.
* Command Line Arguments - believe it or not, this is the first version of
  Peacock to support command line arguments (files for now)!

New in 0.3
* MDI Support - You can open multiple files at once.
* Session Management - All the files open in the last session are opened when
  you start again.
* Couple of more HTML Toolbars.
* Drag N' Drop - You can now drag your files into the editor to open them.

New in 0.2

  last session.
