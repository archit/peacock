Hacking on Peacock
------------------

Well, if you want to hack on Peacock, here are couple of things to be
taken into consideration.

	* Inform me about your plans, if you start hacking on Peacock.
	  Discuss your plans on the peacock-general@lists.sourceforge.net
	  first. What are you changing and basically kinda getting my
	  permission and keeping me informed. Send all patches to the
	  peacock-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list before commiting
	  them to the CVS. And ofcourse get the latest source code from CVS,
	  before starting.
	* My coding style is mostly like Kernel Coding Style with traces
	  of GNU Coding Style, at places like header files. Even then,
	  just take a look at the code and figure it out.
	* Make sure you use Glib equivalent funtions of ANSI C functions
	  as far as possible. This make the program more portable.
	* Keep the code as clean as possible. Hackish patches are not really
	  preferred.
	* Anything I missed here, check up with me.
